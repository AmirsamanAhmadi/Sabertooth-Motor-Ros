This project is for driving custom 4-wheeled robot motors (with front steering via Stepper Motor + rear wheel drive with DC motor) by Arduino with ROS Twist cmd_vel messages. The rear wheel drive gets controlled via Arduino and a Sabertooth Motor Controller from Dimension Engineering. The front steering is controlled via a stepper motor driver.
